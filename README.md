# QUANT---CNN-1
This code represents my work to date using convolutional neural networks to advise stock trading algorithms. A labeled dataset it created using timeseries data containing technical indicators of a stock's performance. The data is formated as pictures which are then used to train the CNN. The performance of the strategy is evaluated compared to the buy&hold strategy.

Some code in this repository is adapted from:
